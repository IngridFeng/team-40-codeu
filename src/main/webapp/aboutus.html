            <p>Aspirational Hobby: Become a professional gamer or a streamer,
                because it would be a whole different experience to play at a competitive level
                and just let thousands of people enjoy watching how I play.</p>
            <p>Ask me About: </p>
            <p>Competitive Programming (solving algorithmic problems from sites like
      	  Codeforces and Hackerrank) </p>
            <p>Basketball (I follow San Antonio Spurs from NBA but I haven't
      	  watched a live game yet) </p>
            <p>Games I play: Dota and CSGO (Not even close to becoming a pro,
                but likes to watch tournament games)

                around the world, photographing everything I find unique. </p>
            <p>Ask me About: I enjoy solving proof based math problems and watching basketball
                but would like to discuss about anything!</p>

            <p>Aspirational Hobby: Skydiving!</p>
            <p>
              I would like to try skydiving! It's just so cool to look at the world from another
              perspective and enjoying so much freedom around your body. I saw so many people doing
              that (and the photos) and really wish that I would have a chance to experience Skydiving
              really soon!
            </p>
            <p>Ask me About: How to play league of legends | which bubble tea is the best</p>
            <p>Not a pro in any of these. But I guess we'll have an interesting discussion:)</p>
