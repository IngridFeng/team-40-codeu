        <li>Summer Feelz: Excited | Thrilled | Chill</li>
        <li>Aspirational Hobby: Become a professional gamer or a streamer,
            because it would be a whole different experience to play at a competitive level
            and just let thousands of people enjoy watching how I play.</li>
        <li>Ask me About: <br /> <br />Competitive Programming (solving algorithmic problems from sites like
  	  Codeforces and Hackerrank) <br /> <br />Basketball (I follow San Antonio Spurs from NBA but I haven't
  	  watched a live game yet) <br /> <br />
  	  Games I play: Dota and CSGO (Not even close to becoming a pro,
            but likes to watch tournament games)</li>

        <li>Aspirational Hobby: Skydiving!
          <p>I would like to try skydiving! It's just so cool to look at the world from another
          perspective and enjoying so much freedom around your body. I saw so many people doing
          that (and the photos) and really wish that I would have a chance to experience Skydiving
          really soon!</p>
