        <p>Aspirational Hobby: Become a professional gamer or a streamer,
            because it would be a whole different experience to play at a competitive level
            and just let thousands of people enjoy watching how I play.</p>
        <p>Ask me About: </p>
        <p>Competitive Programming (solving algorithmic problems from sites like
  	  Codeforces and Hackerrank) </p>

  	  watched a live game yet) </p>

        <p>Aspirational Hobby: Skydiving!</p>
        <p>
          I would like to try skydiving! It's just so cool to look at the world from another
          perspective and enjoying so much freedom around your body. I saw so many people doing
          that (and the photos) and really wish that I would have a chance to experience Skydiving
          really soon!

        <p>Ask me About: How to play league of legends | which bubble tea is the best</p>
